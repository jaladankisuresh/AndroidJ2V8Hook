# AndroidJ2V8Hook
An Android POC Application demonstrating Hybrid MVVM Architecture with (M)Models and (VM)ViewModels defined in Embedded Client Side JavaScript and (V)Views in Android. This App uses Android Databinding library and [J2V8](https://github.com/eclipsesource/J2V8) (Java-to-JavaScript) binding library

> Native Development brings the best user experience and performance  
> Common Business Logic brings the better agility and maintainability    

Get the best of both worlds by going Native(Android or iOS) for UI development and going JavaScript for Business Logic. This POC showcases using JavaScript for Business Logic and executing it on Embedded V8 Engine for Android - [J2V8](https://github.com/eclipsesource/J2V8), while still keeping UI development truly native.
